<center><h1>Introduction to Data Structure</h1></center><br>
<p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
	Computer is an electronic machine which is used for data processing and manipulation.When programmer collects such type of data for processing, he would require to store all of them in computer's main memory.<br>
	In order to make computer work we need to know :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Representation of data in computer.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Accessing of data.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-How to solve problem step by step.<br><br>
	For doing this task we use <strong>Data Structure</strong>.<br><br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	  A data structure is a special way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph etc are all data structures that stores the data in a special way so that we can access and use the data efficiently. <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Each of these mentioned data structures has a different special way of organizing data so we choose the data structure based on the requirement, we will cover each of these data structures in a separate tutorials:<br><br>
