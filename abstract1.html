    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	Like a stack, a queue is also a list. However, with a queue, insertion is done at one end, while deletion is performed at the other end.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Accessing the elements of queues follows a First In, First Out (FIFO) order.
        Like customers standing in a check-out line in a store, the first customer in is the first customer served.
